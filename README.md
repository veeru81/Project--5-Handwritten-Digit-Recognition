# Project 5 Handwritten Digit Recognition

Handwritten digit recognition (HDR) is a subfield of computer vision concerned with the ability of computers to identify handwritten digits from images. 
It's a popular introduction to the field of machine learning and a stepping stone to more complex pattern recognition tasks.

## There are various applications for handwritten digit recognition, including:

  Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in postal services for automated mail sorting

  Analyzing handwritten zip codes on envelopes

  Smart captcha recognition to prevent automated bots from accessing online services

  Self-service kiosks that allow users to input data with a stylus

  Automatic bank check processing to extract account numbers and amounts
